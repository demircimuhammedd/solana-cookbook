# Cooking with Solana

The *Solana Cookbook* is a collection of references and 
concepts aimed at any level of developer. The goal of 
the cookbook is to be a resource for a developer to use 
while building on top of Solana, being able to quickly 
access core code pieces.

## Contributing

The Cookbook is designed in a way that makes it easy for 
new Solana developers to contribute to. Even if you 
don't know how to do something, the contributing to the 
cookbook is a great way to learn!

Check out all open issues [here](https://github.com/solana-dev-adv/solana-cookbook/issues). Contribution guidelines [here](https://github.com/solana-dev-adv/solana-cookbook#contributing). If you find the cookbook is missing a suggestion, please add an issue.
